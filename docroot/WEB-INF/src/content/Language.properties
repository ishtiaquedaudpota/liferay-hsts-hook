hsts=HSTS (RFC 6797)
hsts.all=HSTS timeout for anonymous users in seconds
hsts.configuration=HSTS configuration
hsts.configuration.help.basic=To disable HSTS, set timeout values to 0. Configure the value to the number of seconds that you want to instruct the client browser to purely use https to connect to this domain. A common value suggestion is 31.536.000, equivalent to 365 days. For testing purposes, you want shorter values, e.g. 10 minutes.
hsts.configuration.help.certificate=According to RFC 6797, you'll need a certificate trusted by your browser in order for the setting to be active. A self-signed certificate won't do the trick. Also, you'll need to access the site on https and you'll need to use the standard ports, e.g. 443 for https
hsts.include.subdomain=Include subdomains in HSTS instruction
hsts.user=HSTS timeout for logged in users in seconds
